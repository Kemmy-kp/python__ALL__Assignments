What is List? How will you reverse a list?
======>the .reverse() method in Python is a built-in method that reverses the list in place.

-->Reversing the list in place means that the method modifies and changes the original list. It doesn't create a new list which is a copy of the original but with the list items in reverse order.

syntx: list_name.reverse()

my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

my_numbers.reverse()

print(my_numbers)

o/p:
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
