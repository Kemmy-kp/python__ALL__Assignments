How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?

1)Built-in Functions: These are functions that are available in
Python without the need for any additional modules or libraries.
Examples include print(), len(), range(), int(), str(), etc.

2)User-Defined Functions: These are functions that are defined by the
user to perform a specific task. You can define your own functions using the
def keyword.

3)Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions): These are small, anonymous
functions that can have any number of arguments but can only have one
expression.
They are defined using the lambda keyword.

4)Recursive Functions: These are functions that call themselves in order to
solve a problem. They are particularly useful for tasks that can be broken
down into smaller, similar subtasks.

5)Higher-Order Functions: These are functions that can take other functions
as arguments or return functions as results. This is a feature of functional
programming, and Python supports it.

6)Generator Functions: These are functions that use the yield keyword to
produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them all at
once and returning a list.

7)Method Functions: These are functions that are associated with
objects in object-oriented programming. They are called on instances
of a class and can modify the object's attributes.
























Static Methods and Class Methods: These are special types of methods in a class. Static methods do not take the instance or class as their first argument, and class methods take the class itself as their first argument.
