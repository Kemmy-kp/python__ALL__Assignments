What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

A tuple is a basic data structure in Python that roughly resembles a list but
has some unique features of its own. Tuples are arranged groups of components
denoted by brackets (). The fact that tuples are immutable—that is, that once
you form a tuple, you cannot modify its members or size—is one of the most
important distinctions between tuples and lists.Tuples are the best choice in
situations when data stability and integrity are crucial.

List

Lists are mutable.	
Iteration in lists is time consuming.	
Lists are better for insertion and deletion operations	
Lists consume more memory	
Lists have several built-in methods	
Lists are more prone to unexpected errors

Tuple

Tuples are immutable.
Iteration in tuples is faster
Tuples are appropriate for accessing the elements
Tuples consume lesser memory
Tuples have comparatively lesser built-in methods.
Tuples operations are safe and chances of error are very less
