'''How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python?
Explain with coding snippets.'''

--->Exception handling with try, except, else, and finally

1)Try: This block will test the excepted error to occur
2)Except:  Here you can handle the error
3)Else: If there is no exception then this block will be executed
4)Finally: Finally block always gets executed either exception is generated
or not


try:
       # Some Code.... 

except:
       # optional block
       # Handling of exception (if required)

else:
       # execute if no exception

finally:
      # Some code .....(always executed)
