Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

-->Exception handling is a programming concept that allows a program to deal
with unexpected situations or errors that may occur during its execution.
In Python, exceptions are a way to gracefully handle errors, making the code
more robust and preventing it from crashing.

-->Try Block: The code that might raise an exception is placed inside a try block.
If an exception occurs in this block, Python immediately stops executing the
code in the try block and jumps to the corresponding except block.

-->Except Block: The except block is where you specify the type of exception you
want to catch. If the type of exception raised in the try block matches the
type specified in the except block, the code inside the except block is
executed.

-->Handling Multiple Exceptions: You can have multiple except blocks to handle
different types of exceptions. They will be checked in order, and the first
one that matches the raised exception will be executed.


-->Else Block (optional): You can also include an else block which will be
executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block.

-->Finally Block (optional): The finally block, if present, will be executed
regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It's typically used for
cleanup operations.

-->Syntax Errors: These occur when the code is not written correctly according
to the syntax rules of Python.These errors are caught by the interpreter
before the program is executed.

-->Exceptions: These are errors that occur during the execution of a program.
They are typically caused by something external to the code, like incorrect
user input, network problems, or file access issues. Examples include
ValueError, TypeError, and ZeroDivisionError.
