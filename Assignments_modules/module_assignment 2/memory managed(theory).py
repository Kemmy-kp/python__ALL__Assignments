How memory is managed in Python?
==>Memory management in Python is handled by the Python memory manager, which is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for objects during the program's runtime. Python employs several strategies to manage memory efficiently:

Reference Counting: Python uses a reference counting mechanism to keep track of how many references (pointers) are pointing to an object. When the reference count drops to zero, meaning there are no more references to the object, the memory associated with that object is deallocated automatically.

Garbage Collection: While reference counting is effective, it can't handle circular references where objects reference each other, preventing their reference count from reaching zero. To address this, Python also employs a garbage collector that periodically identifies and deallocates objects with no reachable references.

Automatic Memory Management: Python's memory manager automatically allocates memory for objects when they are created and releases the memory when the objects are no longer in use. This process is transparent to the programmer.

Memory Pools: Python memory manager uses a technique called "memory pooling" to manage memory more efficiently. It allocates memory in blocks of fixed sizes and then assigns these blocks to objects. This reduces fragmentation and overhead.

Memory Optimization Techniques: Python optimizes memory usage by reusing objects when possible. For instance, small integers and strings are cached and reused to avoid the overhead of creating new objects for frequently used values.

Cython and Extensions: When integrating Python with C or other languages, memory management might be handled by the underlying language's memory manager. Tools like Cython allow for more control over memory management when needed.

Memory Views: Python supports memory views that allow arrays and other sequences to share memory with other objects. This can be useful for efficient memory usage, especially in numerical and scientific computing.

Memory Profiling: Python offers tools for profiling memory usage to identify memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.
