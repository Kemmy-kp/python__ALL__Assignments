What are negative indexes and why are they used?

Negative Indexing is used to in Python to begin slicing from the end of the string i.e. the last. Slicing in Python gets a sub-string from a string. The slicing range is set as parameters i.e. start, stop and step.

Syntax
Let us see the syntax âˆ’

#slicing from index start to index stop-1
arr[start:stop]

# slicing from index start to the end
arr[start:]

# slicing from the beginning to index stop - 1
arr[:stop]

# slicing from the index start to index stop, by skipping step
arr[start:stop:step]
